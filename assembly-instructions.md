# Assembly Instructions

Follow these steps to assemble the doorbell circuit using IC 555.

## Steps

1. **Prepare the PCB**: Print the PCB design on a copper board and etch the board to create the circuit paths.
2. **Place Components**: Place the IC socket, resistors, capacitors, push button, and speaker on the PCB according to the schematic diagram.
3. **Solder Components**: Carefully solder each component to the PCB. Ensure there are no short circuits or cold solder joints.
4. **Connect the Battery**: Attach the 9V battery clip to the PCB.
5. **Test the Circuit**: Connect the 9V battery and press the push button to test the doorbell. The speaker should emit a sound when the button is pressed.

## Tips

- Double-check the polarity of capacitors and the orientation of the IC 555 timer.
- Use a multimeter to verify connections and component values before powering the circuit.
